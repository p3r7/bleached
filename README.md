## h2o2d

h2o2d (*peroxidized*) is a fork of [bleached](https://github.com/andr-ew/bleached)'s firmware to support getting its config dumped by sysex and switching between CC / 14-bit CC / NRPN.

the sysex code is heavily inspired by [16n](https://github.com/16n-faderbank/16n)'s firmware.


### similar projects

[Thhhh's fork](https://github.com/Thomasbru/bleached/) also implements 14-bit CC alongside the [14b](https://github.com/Thomasbru/14b-mod) norns mod that allows mapping those high precision values to params ([lines thread](https://llllllll.co/t/14b-mod/63796)).
